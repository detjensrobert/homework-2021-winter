### How are microbes studied?

Most organisms studied in biology are quite large; it is quite easy to tell the status of an organism, be it alive or
dead, what kind of organism it is, etc. Microbes, however, are quite different. There are millions of different types,
but they all look the same under a microscope. Only a small fraction of the millions can be grown in a lab, which can
make studying the "wild" ones harder.

Similar to how common words can be used to categorise literature, similarities in molecular structure within cellular
components can be used to trace the lineage between organisms. Large mutations within, say, a ribosome would cause it
to become non-functional. Small changes, however, may result in a still-functional product. These small changes in the
component RNA or DNA can be used to track the relationships between organisms by how much of their structures are
similar. This technology was originally developed by microbiologists, but has found widespread usage in general biology
for things like human ancestry tracing.

### Microbes in Earth systems

All life needs "thermodynamic diseqilibrium" to get and store energy. This is usually done through oxydation and
reduction half reactions. A reduced and an oxidized compound react to release chemical energy, which the cell can use
to do work.

The majority of microorganisms are inactive. The "surface world" is the portion of the microorganisms that are actively
growing or producing large amounts of carbon. That slow metabolism can contribute to the hardiness of the microbe, with
many microbes present in ocean sediments, even several kilometers under the surface. Microbes can live in a extreme
range of environments or for an extremely long time.

### How have microbes changed the planet?

Mainly, photosynthetic organisms. Sunlight photosynthesis originated about 2.4 BYA, giving microbes a way to fix carbon
away and producing oxygen. Although oxygen was present before, it was part of other molecules and not molecular 0_2.
This lead to an abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere, paving the way for autotrophic and heterotroughic organisms.

Some life also produced methane, which as a greenhouse gas contributed to the warming of the atmostphere (and possibly
the End Permian extintion event).
