# GEO 308 Guest Lecture 3: Peter Clark

## Robert Detjens

Peter Clark was one of the lead authors for a section of the the 5th Assessment Report for the IPCC.

The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is a panel of representatives from 95 different countries set up in
1988 by the World Meteorological Org. and the United Nations Environmental Panel. Climate change was just starting to be
understood as a problem, so this Panel was set up to further the world's understanding of climate change and assess
solutions. To accomplish this, the Panel has 3 working groups that focus on different tasks: WG1's objective is to
detail the scientific basis for climate change, WG2 focuses on the impacts and risks of climate change, and WG3's task
is to detail options for mitigating the effects of climate change.

Working Group 1 has produced an Assessment Report approximately every 5 years since its inception; reports were released
in 1990, 1995, 2001, 2007, and 2015. Once a report is finished, a new one is commissioned pretty much right away. For
efforts promoting awareness about climate change, the IPCC was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.

The 5th Assessment Report was released in 2013 after 4 years of work. A smaller Synthesis Report was released the
following year as a slimmed-down version of the full report intended for policymakers.

Work on AR5 started in 2009 with a rough outline. 259 lead authors were selected to write the chapters the next year. In
total, over 600 additional authors contributed to sections of the report. A total of 4 drafts were produced and
reviewed, with over 55 thousand comments left as part of the review process. All were responded to and the entire review
process, including the comments, were made available publicly. Over 9,200 peer reviewed publications were cited for
the report.

No new research was performed for the report; instead, the conclusions of already-produced reports were collated and
analysed. If a conclusion was consistent across many studies, there is robust evidence for it.

A final draft of 14 chapters was approved by the IPCC in 2013. These chapters cover several topics, including:

- observations of what is happening
- climate cycle
- climate models
- what is responsible
- projections of effects, long term and short term
- sea level change (first time as full chapter)
- local phenomena

Clark was one of two coordinating lead authors for the sea level chapter, along with John Church. Coordinating lead
authors are tasked with coordinating the preparation of the chapter and overlaps with any other chapters. 12 additional
lead authors contributed specific expertise, along with several editors and 57 other contributing authors. All authors
met in person as part of 4 chapter team author meetings during the course of the report, in addition to coordinating
online.

After all drafts were reviewed and the final draft was submitted to the IPCC, a Plenary Meeting was held in Sweden to
finalize the report. During the meeting, the (heavily) abbreviated Summary for Policymakers was walked through
sentence-by-sentence over three days.

The final headline conclusions of the report are as follows:

- "Warming in the climate system is unequivocal."
- "Human influence on the climate system is clear."
- "Global surface temp change for the end of the 21st century is likely to exceed 1.5*C rel. to 1850 for all scenarios."
- "Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions."
