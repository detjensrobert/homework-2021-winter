# GEO 308 Term Paper Introduction

## Robert Detjens

---

I have thought of two viable topics to explore in this term paper:

- Can computer-assisted modelling provide conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of global warming solutions?
- What impact has the proliferation of computer use and manufacturing had on the Earth's climate?

I am inclined to follow through with the second one, as it is more inline with topics I am more familiar with, being a
computer science major with a focus on hardware. However, the first topic feels more inline with the sample topic
statements given.

The latter topic is viable, as there are many sub-topics that can be discussed. Some of which are: the toxicity of
components required for the manufacturing process or end product, whether computer e-waste recyclers actually provide a
net environmental gain, and the possibility for more efficient computer architectures to have a notable impact in power
consumption and global warming. In particular, exploring what the environmental cost of a computer is will be
particularly enlightening. I have partially looked into the manufacturing process previously, but fully exploring all
required materials and their environmental costs may reveal some concerns that I may not realize have had as big of an
impact as I was aware they have.

With regard to the first topic, computer modelling and the analysis of large datasets can or have revealed insights
into climate trends that traditional statistics have not -- whether because of dataset size constraints or processing
power. With supercomputers becoming increasingly more powerful, there may be further details available in data than
previously found. I am less sure of this topic, as I am not super familiar with statistics and analysis.
