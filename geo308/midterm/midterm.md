### 1. Explain how the greenhouse effect works.

The greenhouse effect is cause by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trapping heat in the atmosphere. Short-wave radiation from the Sun is able to pass through the atmosphere and strike the surface of the Earth, warming the planet. The Earth also radiates heat as long-wave radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb that long-wave radiation and prevent it from radiating out into space.

### 2. Explain how carbon isotopes ($\delta^{13}C$) of $CO_2$ can be used as evidence that the current increase in atmospheric $CO_2$ is due to human emissions.

Looking at old ice in ice cores has the amount of $\delta^{13}C$ in the atmosphere over time increasing during the Industrial Revolution. This is evidence that human emissions are increasing $\delta^{13}C$.

### 3. Describe at least two similarities between the climate crisis and the current coronavirus crisis, from the perspective of public policy and perception.

Both of these have a minority arguing that the event is a hoax or is not real and refuse to do anything about it. Governments have also put policies into effect to try and mitigate the effects that these events have, such as emissions regulations and travel lockdowns.

### 4. A recent study showed that the total biomass of oceanic plankton increases in a warmer ocean, leading to more photosynthesis in the oceans. Is this a positive or a negative feedback to climate warming? Explain your reasoning.

This is a negative feedback loop. Photosynthesis captures $CO_2$ out of the atmosphere, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This cools the planet -- and by extension the ocean, reducing the biomass in it. Less plankton biomass means less photosynthesis, leading to less $CO_2$ being captured

### 5. Climate warming is expected to cause more frequent and persistent droughts in arid regions, resulting in desertification. In this process, carbon stored in soils and plants is released as $CO_2$. Is this a positive or a negative feedback to climate warming? Explain your reasoning.

This is a positive feedback loop. A warmer climate causes desertification releasing $CO_2$ into the atmosphere. $CO_2$ is a greenhouse gas, which traps heat and warms the planet.

### 6. Asteroids and comets both orbit the sun. Asteroids are mostly made of rock, and comets of ice. Where do you think they formed in the early solar system? Explain your reasoning.

Asteroids formed in the inner solar system; comets formed in the outer solar system. Denser materials like rock condensated closer to the center of the solar nebula. Lighter materials like ice condensated farther away.

### 7. Describe the process of planetary differentiation. Include volatiles (such as water and atmospheric gases) in your description.

After materials coalesce into a planet, the core of the planet heats up and melts. Dense elements like metals sink to the middle and melt; lighter metals and rocks rise to the surface. Volatile materials like water and gases can be lost to space.

### 8. What is the commonly-used name of the protoplanet that smashed into Earth during the formation of the moon?

That would be Theia.

### 9. Scientists now believe that photosynthesis in eukaryotes evolved through endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria (a prokaryote). Describe in several steps how this evolutionary process works.

Eukaryotes evolved when one bacteria engulfs another. The now-internal bacteria lives inside the engulfer. In the case of cyanobacteria, the engulfed cyanobacteria performs photosynthesis and provides food for both itself and the parent/engulfing cell. The internal bacteria divides when the parent does and maintains a separate lineage from it.

### 10.What are the names of the three eras into which the last 541 Ma of geologic time is divided? Give the names of the two large mass extinction events that separate these eras.

From oldest to most recent: Paleozoic, Mesozoic, Cenozoic.

The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction divides the Mesozoic from the Cenozoic era; the Permian–Triassic divides the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic.

### 11. Iridium layers at the K-Pg boundary (66 Ma ago) provide evidence for a large asteroid impact at that time. Why is Iridium (a metal) rare at Earth’s surface, but common in asteroids?

Since iridium is a dense metal, it melted and sank to the core of Earth during planetary differentiation. Asteroids are not large enough for differentiation to have an effect (and the whole thing impacts Earth anyway) so the iridium stays.

### 12.What bacteria are responsible for the initial rise in atmospheric $O_2$? Explain the role of carbon burial in the rise of atmospheric $O_2$.

Cyanobacteria were the first bacteria to perform photosynthesis and turn $CO_2$ into $O_2$.

As there is a 1:1 ratio between the amount of carbon to oxygen, to create an excess of $O_2$ in the atmosphere, the corresponding carbon needs to be removed out of the cycle. Some carbon, e.g. from dead life, gets deposited into sediments and becomes buried and turned into fossils or fossil fuels.
